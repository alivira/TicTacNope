TicTacNope
==========

The aim of the project was to program an interface that would allow a user to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer. The computer would be able to recognize and effectively respond to player moves, preventing the player from winning. Thus, the computer is said to be unbeatable. Using a GUI, computer and player moves can be effectively and aesthetically presented to the user. A loss and tie display, and a reset button are also included so that the user can keep track of their progress.
